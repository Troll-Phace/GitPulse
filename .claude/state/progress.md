## Completed Phases
### Phase 3: Keychain Service — COMPLETED 2026-04-12
- [x] 3.1 KeychainError enum + KeychainProviding protocol + KeychainService struct (SecItem API, upsert semantics, injectable service name)
- [x] 3.2 MockKeychainService (dictionary-backed, @unchecked Sendable)
- [x] 3.3 13 tests: 10 real-Keychain integration tests + 3 mock-fidelity tests, all passing
- Verification: 37 total tests pass, no token values in logs, build clean

### Phase 2: SwiftData Models — COMPLETED 2026-04-12
- [x] 2.1 Implemented all 6 @Model classes: Contribution, Repository, LanguageStat, PullRequest, UserProfile, SyncMetadata
- [x] 2.2 SchemaV1 as VersionedSchema with all 6 models
- [x] 2.3 GitPulseSchemaMigrationPlan with SchemaV1 as only stage, GitPulseApp.swift updated with migration plan
- [x] 2.4 23 model tests: creation, relationships, cascade delete, unique upsert, computed properties, schema verification

### Phase 1: Xcode Project Scaffold — COMPLETED 2026-04-12
- [x] 1.1 Created 4 targets: GitPulse, GitPulseWidgetExtension, GitPulseTests, GitPulseUITests. macOS 26, Swift 6, strict concurrency.
- [x] 1.2 Full directory structure matching ARCHITECTURE.md §7.7 with ~50 placeholder .swift files
- [x] 1.3 Info.plist with BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers. Entitlements with app group for both app + widget.
- [x] 1.4 GitPulseApp.swift with ModelContainer using groupContainer: .identifier("group.com.gitpulse.shared")

## Current Phase Tasks
- [ ] 4.1 Implement GitHubAPIClient with URLSession, auth header, error handling
- [ ] 4.2 Implement GitHubError typed error enum
- [ ] 4.3 Implement rate-limit tracking (X-RateLimit-* headers)
- [ ] 4.4 Implement Link header pagination parser
- [ ] 4.5 Write tests with URLProtocol mock

## Success Criteria
- [ ] fetchUserProfile() decodes a mock /user response correctly
- [ ] 401 response throws .unauthorized
- [ ] 403 with rate-limit headers throws .rateLimited with correct reset date
- [ ] Pagination fetches all pages until rel="next" is absent
- [ ] All API client tests pass
